# Execution status

M0 complete: architecture v1, scope, threat model, conflict/recovery state machine,
roadmap and test strategy written. Inspected clean main at c32d009 (MIT preserved).
Validation: repository inspection; documentation cross-check (no code tests yet).
Push: not attempted. Next: M1 foundations and isolated init/config/CLI tests.
Safety concerns: all behavior is currently specification, not implemented.

M1 complete: installable Python 3.12 package, Typer CLI, private external init,
strict configuration/discovery, moved-root detection, SQLite v1 and flock.
Validation: editable install succeeded; `pytest tests/unit/test_project.py -q`:
11 passed. Last commit before M1: 19b11d3. Push pending snapshot gate.
Next: M2 scanner/store/checkpoint acceptance. No destructive operations yet.
